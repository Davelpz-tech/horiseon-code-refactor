# Horiseon: Code Refactor

## Horiseon is a webpage for visitors to learn about basic SEO information such as: What is SEO, how to manage your online reputation, how does social media marketing play into SEO, etc.

## We want to provide all people the opportunity to learn about SEO in an easy and interactive way. SEO can often be very confusing to understand. Horiseon offers some of the most important aspects of SEO and describes them simply without sacrificing crucial information.

## Horiseon solves the issue of having to read through overly comples and extensive articles online which attempt to explain SEO. However, most website owners are small businesses trying to get their names out there. Sometimes they spread themselves a little too thin by managing their companies and dipping their toes into the web world. We want to provide the information for all levels of web knowledge.

## I learned how to structure semantic html and keep order of HTML inline with the order of the CSS styling.
